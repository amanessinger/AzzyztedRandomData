# AzzyztedRandomData
A library to generate random but plausible test data

This project is in its embryonic phase. There is no useful functionality yet. 
The plan is, to create a Java library that can generate **given names**, **surnames**, 
**addresses**, **social security numbers** and other such things that tests of or
prototypes for applications need. 

The directory doc/mind_map contains a SimpleMind mind map and two exports as PDF and 
TXT outline. Have a look at that for the concepts that I'm after.
